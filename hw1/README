This Java application is a simple drawing program that operates similarly to 
Microsoft Paint. The user can click and drag within the drawing area to create
lines and/or whatever shapes that they would desire. Drawings can be made in
three colors, and there is a clear/erase all button to erase all user drawings
in the drawing area.

To compile and run execute the following commands:
javac Main.java
java Main
